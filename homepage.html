        <p>
          This website will have some cool information about various math topics, such
          as the history of math, calculus, and linear algebra. Please note that this
          website, although it is informative, is not meant to serve as a sort of
          Wikipedia or comprehensive encyclopedia for these math topics. This website, first
          and foremost, is just a place for me to share and write about some cool topics in math,
          and to practice my web development and general written communication skills.

          With that said, welcome to my website, and I hope you learn something cool!

      <header><h2>Basic Arithmetic and Fraction Calculator</h2></header>
      <p>
        Here is a basic arithetic calculator to get you started. In addition to whole
        numbers, it can also take fractions as input.
        Here are some sample inputs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 + 1 - 3 * 2</li>
        <li>1/2 + 1/2 * 0</li>
        <li>2 / (1/3 + 5)</li>
      </ul>

      <label for="expression">Type your expression here</label>
      <input type="text" placeholder="1 + 1 * 1/2" id="expression">
      <button id="do-arithmetic-button">Do arithmetic!</button>
      <span>The results will be logged down below</span>
      <aside id="calculator-credits">
        Credits: I coded the calculator myself, but the algorithm I used
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm"
        target="_blank">Shunting-yard</a>)
        , was invented by Edsger Dijkstra.
        BTW, please feel free to let me know if there are any bugs!
